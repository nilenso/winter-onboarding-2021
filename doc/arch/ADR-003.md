# Title
Passing spec generator to generalised factory will generate and create data in the DB

# Context
While writing tests, we generally need to generate & insert sample data in the database to test our code's behaviour.

It is crucial that these factories provide us an easy, intuitive and flexible way of generated  & inserting data into DB.
Ideally, these factories should also provide us a way for supplying override values.

Earlier, we made factories for each model seprately & they only generated data(not inserted them).
It was getting a little cumbersome to write tests using the above factories because of much repetitive code.

The new factories will accept a spec generator & a table name where the generated data will be inserted.

# Decision
It has been decided to move ahead with generalising the factories

Example:
```
;; For generating & creating a user in DB
(factories/create :users (s/gen ::specs/users))

;; For generating & creating a user in DB with some override values
(factories/create :users (gen/fmap #(assoc % :users/name "Custom name")
                         (s/gen ::specs/users)))

;; For generating a list of 10 fleets in DB
(factories/create-list :fleets 10 (s/gen ::specs/fleets))
```

# Status
Accepted

# Consequences
Pros:
Easy API for genrating variety of data and inserting it in database

Cons:
It still doesn't solve for creating associations between different entities.
We will have to do it manually just like we did before.
