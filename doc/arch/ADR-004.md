# Title

Handle different view logic depending on role of us.

# Context

We started with 3 approaches to decide how we wanted to handle view.

1. Using combinators
2. Using different view for different roles
3. Having one view and put conditionals according to the role

### 1. combinators

**Pros:**

1. Our code will be broken into simpler chunks

**Cons:**

1. Lots of changes in the current implementation
2. The placement of components with respect to each other becomes hard to maintain
3. Less abstraction/ generalisation is possible 

### 2. Different view for different roles

**Pros:**

1. Adds simplicity 
2. More readable

Cons:

1. Code duplication
2. Modification to existing codebase (not much)

### 3. One view

**Pros:**

1. Less code, and least modification to existing code

**Cons:**

1. Disobey SRP
2. With more logic and as app grows , it will be harder to maintain

# Decision

A combination of approach 2 and 3. If the difference in view is very less for different role (like a button appears for admin but not for driver and manager) then we will go for the approach 3 with one view and put conditionals depending on roles. If the difference in ui is a lot (like the fleets description page) we will create different component for the same view for different roles.

# Consequences

Since we are combining approach 2 and 3, we wonâ€™t have a generalised structure. There will less code duplication and the code readability will be maintained.
