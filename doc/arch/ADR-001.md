# Title
Using server-side sessions for authentication, instead of JWTs.

# Context
In FMS, there are multiple types of users, which need to be authenticated for doing some actions. The application has the following requirements:

- Remote-logout is required
- Admin should be able to change the role of other users in the fleet, and that change needs to be reflected instantly.

There were options like using JWTs and using server-side sessions. 

# Decision
We decided to use server-side sessions, to meet the above requirements. Also, using server-side sessions will help the developers in learning server-side sessions.

# Status
Accepted.

# Consequences
Using sessions will add some extra work for the server. But, it also provides mechanisms to remotely log out a user. In terms of scalability, it may not be optimal, but given the requirements, other solutions would require the same or even extra work.
