;; Maps, Vectors, and Sets also behave like functions!
;; - We don't normally use maps and vector in the function

;;   with doing so), but we often use _well-defined_ sets as
;;   predicate functions, to test for set membership.

(#{"a" "b" "c"} "boo") ; falsey: return `nil` if it doesn't

;; Lists do NOT behave like functions
